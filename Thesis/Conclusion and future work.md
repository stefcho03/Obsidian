\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}

Some introductory paragraph.


\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, a framework for evaluating different setups was created. Using it, a setup with promising results in 3DoF was chosen and validated in 1DoF. The results from the real-world experiment show this method to be a viable substitution to IMUs at least in 1DoF applications. 




\section{Future Work}

In the future a more sophisticated experimental setup is to be developed. This would allow gathering more precise data from all 3 DoF. Another possible method for gathering more data without the need of a lot of real-world data gathering is mapping the simulation data to the already gathered real data and using the already existing neural networks. 
2 or more sensor setups could also be looked into more. Combining the advantages of 2-sensor setup with the advantages of 2-magnet setup may prove to be beneficial for both accuracy and robustness. 
Another direction in which this work can be developed is the development of more accurate prediction methods such as deeper Neural Networks and RNNs if the goal is accurate estimation of the relative movement.
