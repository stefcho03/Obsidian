Goniometer - device used to measure the rotation angle of a joint
Joint configuration - the position of the rotating part relative to the static part. It is defined by the 3 rotation angles and 3 translations along the 3 axes. 
Magnet-sensor setup - The number, position, and orientation of the magnet(s) and sensor(s) in the joint.
Static part - the part of the joint that houses the sensor(s). For the simulation and experiment, it is fixed in space.
Rotating part - the part of the joint that houses the magnet(s). For the simulations and experiment, it is moving around the static part.
Degree of freedom (DoF) - The minimum number of independent variables required to define the position or motion of the system
Magnet-sensor setup - The way the magnets and sensors are positioned in the joint
Joint configuration - Position of the joint, described by rotation and translation
LLE - lower limb exoskeleton
NN - Neural network
RNN - Recurrent neural network
RCJ - Rolling contact joint
DoF - Degree of freedom
