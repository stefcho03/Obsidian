Role of the magnetec field of the earth
Due to the magnetic field of the earth a few adjustments had to be made. Although the magnetic field is ? times weaker than the magnetic field from the strong neodymium magnets, it stil caused prediction errors up to 4 degrees. The offset however stays relatively stable throughout the whole range of motion and its effect could be theoretically removed if the sensor is used in combination with a compass. This could be done to achieve higher precision of the measurements. 
Role of metal parts in the joint
With the higher sensitivity settings of the sensor, metal parts around the joint have influenced the magnetic field and consequently the readings, leading to different behaviour of the sensor readings. With lower sensitivity settings the metal/magnetic objects have to be closer to the joint, however their influence cannot be fully eliminated. The radius within which metal and magnetic elements have an influence is around 5 cm. Because the metal pins, which hold the tensioning ropes are within that range and the sensor setup could not be as accurately placed, the simulation behavior is different than the real behavior. To combat this effect, the sensor in the simulation was rotated with 10 degrees around its y-axis. This allowed for significant improvement in behavior similarity between simulated and real data.
