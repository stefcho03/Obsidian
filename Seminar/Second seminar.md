**Situation**
- We are standing in a park
- Between us is a big tree
- I can hear you but I can't see you
Research question: Why can I hear you but I can't see you?
 - Rephrase an observation to a question
**Thesis** (can be more than one) - represents a simple statement
	- I can hear you but I can't see you, because... (Light can't go through trees, but sound can)
- Briefly and and pointedly formulated
- Requires argumentative reasoning
- A useful antithesis can be formulated
Avoid:
	Statements of fact (can be easily proven)
	Commonplaces (nobody would disagree)

Thesis: Sound can penetrate wood, but light cannot

**Hypothesis** - subcategory of thesis - claims a correlation between at least two parameters, based on the assumption of a cause effect relationship
- If this is true, then I should be able to observe ... 
If light is absorbed by trees, but sound is not, then I should be able to detect sound through a wood wall, but not light

**Assumption** (axiom) - The overarching concept of thesis and hypothesis
Theses accepted to be true but not subject for verification

**Theory** a system of tested hypotheses intended to explain a specific detail of the reality

Conclusion - returning to the question, not summary
